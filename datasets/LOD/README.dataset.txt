**Detecting Landscape Objects on Satellite Images with Artificial Intelligence**
In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for image recognition and object detection. This technology has proven to be useful in a wide range of applications, from self-driving cars to facial recognition systems. In this project, the focus lies on using AI to detect landscape objects in satellite images (aerial photography angle) with the goal to create an annotated map of The Netherlands with all the coordinates of the given landscape objects.

**Background Information**

***Problem Statement***
One of the things that Naturalis does is conducting research into the distribution of wild bees (Naturalis, n.d.). For their research they use a model that predicts whether or not a certain species can occur at a given location. Representing the real world in a digital form, there is at the moment not yet a way to generate an inventory of landscape features such as presence of trees, ponds and hedges, with their precise location on the digital map. The current models rely on species observation data and climate variables, but it is expected that adding detailed physical landscape information could increase the prediction accuracy. Common maps do not contain this level of detail, but high-resolution satellite images do.

***Possible opportunities***
Based on the problem statement, there is at the moment at Naturalis not a map that does contain the level of detail where detection of landscape elements could be made, according to their wishes. The idea emerged that it should be possible to use satellite images to find the locations of small landscape elements and produce an annotated map. Therefore, by refining the accuracy of the current prediction model, researchers can gain a profound understanding of wild bees in the Netherlands with the goal to take effective measurements to protect wild bees and their living environment.

***Goal of project***
The goal of the project is to develop an artificial intelligence model for landscape detection on satellite images to create an annotated map of The Netherlands that would therefore increase the accuracy prediction of the current model that is used at Naturalis. The project aims to address the problem of a lack of detailed maps of landscapes that could revolutionize the way Naturalis conduct their research on wild bees. Therefore, the ultimate aim of the project in the long term is to utilize the comprehensive knowledge to protect both the wild bees population and their natural habitats in the Netherlands.

***Data Collection Google Earth*** 
One of the main challenges of this project was the difficulty in obtaining a qualified dataset (with or without data annotation). Obtaining high-quality satellite images for the project presents challenges in terms of cost and time. The costs in obtaining high-quality satellite images of the Netherlands is 1,038,575 $ in total (for further details and information of the costs of satellite images. On top of that, the acquisition process for such images involves various steps, from the initial request to the actual delivery of the images, numerous protocols and processes need to be followed.

After conducting further research, the best possible solution was to use Google Earth as the primary source of data. While Google Earth is not allowed to be used for commercial or promotional purposes, this project is for research purposes only for Naturalis on their research of wild bees, hence the regulation does not apply in this case.
